# Autonomous Analytics Platform  
### Multi‑Agent System for End‑to‑End Data Intelligence

This repository contains a production‑grade, multi‑agent analytics platform designed to autonomously ingest, clean, analyze, model, and generate insights from real‑world business datasets. The system is built for **resource‑constrained enterprises** that lack dedicated data teams but still need high‑quality analytics.

The platform is modular, scalable, and fully orchestrated using a deterministic workflow engine. It is designed around the **Favorita Grocery Sales dataset**, a complex real‑world forecasting dataset from Ecuador.
